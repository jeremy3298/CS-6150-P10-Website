        Here is a literature survey we wrote. We went over surveys done in similar industries to our partner organization
        and analyzed them in an effort to make sure the survey we create for Renewvia is as good as possible&nbsp;

        <p className="text-lg mt-4 text-left">Our changes to the Renewvia survey can be contextualized to a few main points:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>Strengthen the baseline data to better track pre-electrification income, energy, and socio-economic levels. </li>
          <li>Isolate Impact by collecting data from a control group in neighborhoods with a similar demographic. </li>
          <li>Adding new metrics from additional questions related to network connection, gender roles, education, and income in order to align further with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the UN.</li>
          <li>Altering existing questions to align with the SDGs and frameworks like the Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index. Furthermore, existing gaps in the survey have been fixed by removing biases in certain questions and altering them to gather more data (asking questions in a scaled or qualitative way rather than a binary way).</li>
          <li>Changing the structure of the survey so it can be given out at certain intervals (6, 9, 12 months post-electrification) to track changes in metrics over time rather than a one-time impact.</li>
          <li>Receive household feedback on mini-grid connection</li>
        </ul>
